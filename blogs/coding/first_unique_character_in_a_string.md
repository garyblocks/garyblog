## First Unique Character in a String
Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**

```
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode",
return 2.
```
**Note:** You may assume the string contain only lowercase letters.

**Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        # build hash map : character and how often it appears
        count = collections.Counter(s)
        
        # find the index
        for idx, ch in enumerate(s):
            if count[ch] == 1:
                return idx     
        return -1
```
Use a hashmap to record if a character is unique, than loop through the string again to check.
