## Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```
**Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1, l2):
        if l1 is None:
            return l2
        elif l2 is None:
            return l1
        elif l1.val < l2.val:
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
            return l1
        else:
            l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next)
            return l2
```
This can be solved recursively, each time we pick the smaller node and merge the rest lists.
