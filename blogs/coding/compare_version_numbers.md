## Compare Version Numbers
Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If `version1` > `version2` return `1`; if `version1` < `version2` return `-1`;otherwise return `0`.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.

The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be `0`. For example, version number `3.4` has a revision number of `3` and `4` for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both `0`.

**Example:**

```
Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
Output: -1
```
```
Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
Output: 1
```
```
Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
Output: -1
```
```
Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”
```
```
Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
```

**Note:**

* Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots `.` and this numeric strings *may* have leading zeroes.
* Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.
