## Course Schedule
There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite *pairs*, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example:**

```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

* The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
* You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
* `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

**Code:**
