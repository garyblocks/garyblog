## Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Example:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Code:**

```
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
    dic, res, start, = {}, 0, 0
    for i, ch in enumerate(s):
        if ch in dic:
            # update the res
            res = max(res, i-start)
            # here should be careful, like "abba"
            start = max(start, dic[ch]+1)
        dic[ch] = i
    return max(res, len(s)-start)
```
