## Word Ladder II
Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is not a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example**:

```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

**Code:**

```
class Solution(object):
    def findLadders(self, beginWord, endWord, wordList):
        wordList = set(wordList)
        res = []
        layer = {}
        layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]
        while layer:
            newlayer = collections.defaultdict(list)
            for w in layer:
                if w == endWord: 
                    res.extend(k for k in layer[w])
                else:
                    for i in range(len(w)):
                        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                            neww = w[:i]+c+w[i+1:]
                            if neww in wordList:
                                newlayer[neww]+=[j+[neww] for j in layer[w]]
            wordList -= set(newlayer.keys())
            layer = newlayer
        return res
```
